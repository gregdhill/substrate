# Benchmarks

This directory contain real world (ink) contracts which are used in macro benchmarks.
Those benchmarks are not used to determine weights but rather to measure real world
behaviour for informational purposes. Those include:

- Comparing different execution engines (wasmi, wasmer, ...)
- Checking whether execution time is consistent with weights
